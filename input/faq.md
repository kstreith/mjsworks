## <a id="about_paintings"></a> About Encaustic Paintings

All my encaustic paintings are original works and hand-painted. They are painted on wood birch panels with 7/8 inch thickness on the side unless otherwise noted in the image description. The paintings are ready to hang with gallery gauge wire on back and should hang flush on the wall.

My encaustic paintings are typically made from cosmetic grade bees wax with [damar resin](http://www.encausticpaints.com/OurProducts/Sundries/DamarResin/tabid/387/Default.aspx) added and pigments for color, but may include other mixed media elements depending on the painting.
Encaustic is a beeswax-based paint that is kept molten on a heated palette. It is applied to a surface and reheated to fuse the paint into a uniform enamel-like finish. The term “Encaustic” is derived from the Greek word “enkaien” and means “to burn into”.  

The durability of encaustic is due to the fact that beeswax is impervious to moisture. Because of this it should not deteriorate, it should not yellow, and it should not darken. Encaustic paintings do not have to be varnished or protected by glass.  As with any painting it is not recommended to hang it in direct sun light. The wax should not reach melting point until around 150 to 200 degrees fahrenheit.

## <a id="how_to_care"></a> How to care for Encaustic Paintings

To return the painting to its original luster, simply buff the surface with a soft cloth. Caution should be used on paintings that include mixed media elements as this may damage the painting.
