With encaustic the surface can be smooth or heavily textured. The surreal glow of the wax always draws me in. It is what made me fall in love with painting using beeswax.

*"In Marcia's workshop, I not only walked away with a deeper knowledge of encaustic. I also had a marvelous painting."*

I enjoy teaching and introducing students to encaustic. At the end of the class my hope is they will learn something and fall in love with encaustic like I did.

Encaustic is a beeswax-based paint that is kept molten on a heated palette. The term *“Encaustic”* is derived from the Greek word *“enkaien”* and means *“to burn into”*. The old Egyptians pioneered this technique of applying molten, colored wax to various surfaces more than 2000 years ago.
