Description: Learn about Marcia Jo Streithorst

After graduating from college with a bachelor degree in fine art I worked on the corporate side of the art world until my move to North Carolina. Thanks to the move I was given the chance to be an artist full time and since then I have never looked back. I am very involved in the art community in Raleigh. I am a member of the NCMMAG, VAE and help out with the Wake Forest Arts as well. I have had my work featured in galleries in Virginia, Ohio and all over North Carolina. I love teaching and helping people learn about encaustic art. My studio is a sanctuary full of color, light and magic just like my paintings.
