Join encaustic artist Marcia Streithorst for a fun mixed media class where you will learn how to use paper and wax to make a fun mixed media collage painting. We will cover elements of a balanced composition, cover how to pick out papers that work best with wax and how to use mark making to add interest to your painting. You will paint on a wood birch panel using an encaustic medium (e.g. wax with resin) and a heat gun. In this workshop you will learn how to safely use encaustic supplies and all about the different papers and inks/stains that work well with wax. A $20 supply fee must be paid to the instructor on the day of the workshop. This workshop is suited for all skill levels.
