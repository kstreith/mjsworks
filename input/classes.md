Want to take your photography to the next level? Want to learn how to incorporate photographs into your work? Then join me as I teach you all about encaustic painting while walking you though a photo transfer into your encaustic painting. You will paint on a wood box using encaustic medium (e.g. wax with resin) and a heat gun. In this workshop you will learn how to safely use encaustic supplies. You will also learn how to get a smooth or textured surface and how to incorporate photography and other mixed media materials in your work. Students will walk away with their completed painting on a keepsake box. Cost is $80 with all supplies included.
