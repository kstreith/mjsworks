Do you love art but are completely out of wall space? Is your home small but your love of art is big? Then join me as I walk you through the steps to craft your very own mixed media project on a up-cycled cigar box. You will paint the top of the cigar box using encaustic medium (e.g. wax with resin) and a heat gun. In this workshop you will learn how to safely use encaustic supplies. If you have any paper or found objects you would like to incorporate into your project feel free to bring them. All supplies are included in the price of the class. Students will walk away with their completed cigar box.  To register call 910-742-3319.
