Join encaustic artist Marcia Streithorst as she teaches about the rich history of encaustic painting. What you will need to set up your own encaustic space, how to get a smooth surface, how to use art supplies you already have with encaustic and how to add texture to your work. When the workshop is done, you will walk away with a finished mixed media painting! A registration fee of $60 is required and includes all supplies. This workshop is recommended for adults with some prior knowledge of art making.
