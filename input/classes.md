Deborah Young at Soulful heART Studio will be hosting guest artist, Marcia Streithorst, for another one of her FABULOUS creative encaustic workshops.  She will teach us the basics of encaustic and how to safely setup an encaustic studio.  There will be a variety of substrates for participants to paint on and mixed media materials to use throughout the workshop. She’ll assist everyone in learning how to transfer images, get a smooth surface, embed different types of papers and other natural objects into wax, and finally add marks using encaustic tools and oil sticks.  If you have special papers, shells or feathers, etc., you would like to bring and use, please feel free to do so. Art experience not necessary to register for this CREATIVE workshop.
