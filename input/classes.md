Join encaustic artist Marcia Streithorst as she teaches you all about encaustic painting while walking you through the steps to craft your very own beautiful mermaid painting. You will paint on a wood birch panel using encaustic medium (e.g. wax with resin) and a heat gun. In this workshop you will learn how to safely use encaustic supplies. You will also learn how to get a smooth or textured surface and how to embed other mixed media materials in your work. You’ll walk away with your small completed painting. A materials fee of $20 is payable to the instructor on the day of the workshop. This workshop is suited for all skill levels.
