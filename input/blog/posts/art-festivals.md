I love art festivals, you love them, and maybe you want start selling at them. Here are a few of the things I love most about being a vendor at art festivals.
 
In a world where so much business (yes even art) is conducted online, festivals are a great way to meet and greet your customers. Not only do you get a chance to sell your art, but you get to see how people react to your art. Are they reacting to your art the way you hoped? The feedback you get can be very helpful and even push your art in a wonderfully new direction. Art festivals can also be a great way to test out new products that you are working on as well. Art festivals give you the opportunity to connect with other small business owners. Over the past year I have gotten great advice on what art shows to attend, best place to buy supplies, what apps to use to help run my business more efficiently and so much more! The same goes for meeting new and existing customers. I love hearing where they are going to hang my art or why they bought my art. Gallery owners also frequently attend art shows looking for new artist or teachers. I can personally say that I have made many wonderful connections at art festivals.

Lastly, I spend most my time working, running my art business and taking care of my family. Doing all this leaves little time to travel (another one of my great passions in life). So, I love the fact that traveling for art shows gives me a chance to leave the studio and see new places. I always try to make time to see new art and eat at local restaurants.

You may have noticed that nowhere on my list is making money. Yes, I do make money by attending art festivals. For me getting out of the studio and all the reasons I listed above are so much more important in the long run. Being a working artist is a long-term investment in yourself and your community. For me being out in that community is what keeps me going. Art festivals reenergize not only me but also my art work!
