My personal happy place is the beach. In fact, it is the number one reason why I love living in North Carolina. I am just a few hours from the ocean. Just seeing the waves roll in and out, hearing the water hitting the beach calms and centers me.

The color of the waters and the sand vary depending on the time of year and the light, so I never tire of it. Capturing all of this is the challenge I face everytime I paint a seascape. The challenge is both capturing the colors of the ocean and beach and capturing the feeling of standing in front of the rushing waves. The taste of salt in the air is what I hope to capture with my ocean seascape paintings. Whenever I do not know what to paint, I go back to my ocean paintings. I think every artist has favorite subject to paint, one that they never tire of.
