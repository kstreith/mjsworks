So sometimes I forget how far I have come with my art and how much I have learned along the way. 
Like most people I am very focused on where I want to go but not where I have been, and now I have decided to share with you what a working artist career can look like.  When I moved to North Carolina five years ago my kids had both started school and I found myself looking for ways to get to know this exciting new town we moved to. I started going to local art shows and meeting lots of new people. Since I live in North Raleigh, I joined the Wake forest Artist guild, and soon after that I joined Visual Art Exchange in downtown Relight.  Being a member of both these great groups helped me realized my dream of being a working artist. I was given to opportunity to learn from other artist, get wonderful feedback on my own work and find venues to show my work. I have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to network with so many talented artists that live in the Triangle. Currently I am part of the Carolina Mixed Media Artist Guild board. Thanks to this group of hard-working artists I was able to embrace that term “Mixed Media” and finally let my inner artist be free to experiment, learn and grow. So in short the first step to being an artist to just get out there and meet other artist, have fun making your art and never stop learning.
