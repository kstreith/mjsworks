Since Covid-19 I have gone back to painting small.

I had forgotten how much I love the challenge of painting small. With less space on the canvas, the more every brush stroke counts! With a smaller canvas, the colors are closer to each other, so you need a lot of punch from every color to have a successful painting. I personally find painting small just as challenging as working on a large painting. I currently find painting small more satisfying.

Another advantage to working small is that it is easier to work on more then one painting at a time. This is a great way to try out ideas for a larger body of work or series of work. So I challenge you to make a small engaging world with all the impact of a large one.
