So, the question I get asked most is, *“Why are you an encaustic painter?”*

Well simply put why wouldn’t I? You can do anything with it, there are virtually no limitations except the ones you put on yourself when using encaustic. I first saw an encaustic paint a few years ago shortly after my move from Ohio to North Carolina. I was instantly drawn in the texture and searal glow of the wax. Having a printmaking and photography background my first thoughts where "what a wonderful way to breath new life into my photography" and " What strong, bold lines you can carve into the wax". After talking to a local encaustic artist who was kind enough to answer all my questions, I have to say I was hooked! 
I gathered all the basic supplies and started my own small encaustic studio. I started small, working with my photographs, learning how to get a nice even and smooth surface. Then getting a perfect transfer of the photo onto the wax and then bringing a bold line to the art work.
Every painting is a adventure and challenge between the natural materials( bees wax and the resin that make up encaustic), and the heat of my blow torch. The biggest element to adjust to when using encaustic is that it must stay hot to work with it. I have learned over time to skillfully use my blow torch to create dream like backgrounds, to rushing waves on the beach. To lightly kiss the wax with just enough heat to fuse thin layers of wax with paper,feather and so much more embedded in the layers. My how with these blog post is that the reader can learn more about encaustic and fall in love with this wonderful media just like I did and to see all the fun challenges one can have when painting with a blow torch!
