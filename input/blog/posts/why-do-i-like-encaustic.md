So, the question I get asked most is, *“Why are you an encaustic painter?”*

Well simply put why wouldn’t I? You can do anything with it, there are virtually no limitations except the ones you put on yourself when using encaustic.

I learned this when I did my first challenge. I am part of the North Carolina Mixed Media Artist Guild, and every few months we have fun challenges for our members to participate in. This time around it was a fiber challenge, everyone had to make a piece of art using fiber in their work. I do not sew. I do not paint on cloth. So looking around my studio I was almost at a loss as to what to do. Then I saw a small feather I had picked up at the beach on my last visit.

Next thing you know I am embedding feathers into a painting and that is how I got started doing what I like to call encaustic challenges.
