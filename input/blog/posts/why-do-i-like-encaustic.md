Why do I like Encaustic?

So, the question I get asked most is “Why do you use encaustic?” 

Well simply put why wouldn’t I! You can do anything with it, there are virtually no limitations except the ones you put on yourself when using encaustic. I learned this when I did my first challenge. I am part of the North Carolina Mixed Media Artist Guild, and every few months we have fun challenges for our members to participate in. This time around it was a fiber challenge, everyone had to make a piece of work using fiber in their work. I do not sew, I do not paint on cloth so looking around my studio I was almost at a loss as to what to do. Then I saw a small feather I had picked up at the beach on my last visit.

Next thing you know I am embedding feathers into a painting and that is how I got started doing what I like to call encaustic challenges.
