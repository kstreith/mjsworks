After almost two years of not doing a full teaching schedule and art shows, I have jumped back in with both feet this year. I am excited and grateful that the world around me is starting to feel normal again.

I love the rush of deadlines for shows and the need to get work finished.  I will be doing my first out of state art show in April at Virginia Arts in the Park in Richmond, VA.  I'm very excited to see how this show goes and meet new clients and see old friends. So let's open the windows and let the fresh spring air in and get ready to enjoy the upcoming festival session.
