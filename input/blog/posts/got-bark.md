Have you ever been on a delightful hike and wanted to bring the sights and feel of your hike home with you? Well challenge excepted! When I’m hiking, I love to look at all the trees and this got me thinking about what a great texture bark has. So there I am taking picture of trees and picking up bark off the ground everywhere I go. Back in the studio the fun can begin. I start mapping out my painting to do this I start picking out what bark to use, print out the photos of the trees and start to think about the over all feeling I want the painting to have. Now this could be a disaster. I might hate the way the bark looks after I have embedded it in the wax, or maybe it will not work, but that is the fun of a challenge right!

I’m happy to say the results are great. The bark looks darker under the wax, but the best is I was able to color bark using wax and pan pastels. I enjoyed this challenge so much I will be doing more paintings using bark.
