**The artistic works of Marcia Jo Streithorst**.

My passion is inspiring the viewer’s imagination. My love of photography combined with a fascination for the tactile experience of encaustics gives my mixed media artworks a dreamlike quality evoking visions of fairy tale worlds that appear almost real, like dreams just beginning to take shape. With encaustic the surface can be smooth or heavily textured, but that surreal glow will always draw me in. It’s what made me fall in love with beeswax painting!

I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Wright State University in 2003 and have worked in creative venues since that time. I am currently a member of Visual Art Exchange, Carolina Mixed Media Artist Guild and have my work on permanent display at the Artists' Loft in Wake Forest. I am very active in the Raleigh art scene and have had my work in shows and galleries all over North Carolina.
