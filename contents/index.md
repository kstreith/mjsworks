The artistic works of Marcia Jo Streithorst.
 
As an artist, I create original works of art that deconstruct the mundane and ordinary into something new and surprising. Photography is my preferred medium to work in but I also like to paint and use other mediums as well. Most of my work is abstract which focus on the shapes and composition within the pieces. I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Wright State University and have been working in the creative field ever since. I am an active member of the [Wake Forest Artist Guild](http://wakeforestguild.com/our-members/streithorst_marcia_mg/). 

I also create mixed media functional works of art and wearable knitted goods for the non-profit group [Threads of Grace](http://www.threadsofgrace.org/). These goods can be purchased at [Storytellers Bookshop in Wake Forest, NC](http://www.storystorewf.com/).
