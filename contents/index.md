The artistic works of Marcia Jo Streithorst.
 
As an artist, I strive to create original works of art that deconstruct the mundane and ordinary into something new and surprising. Photography is my preferred medium to work, but also like to paint and other mediums as well. Most of my work is abstract which forces the viewer to focus on the shapes and composition within the pieces.
